# pacificshipping
Tool to track shipping routes and model decarbonisation scenarios in the Pacific.

There are 3 main applications in this tool pack:
(1) pacificshipping.py - this analyses service routes and maps them using a sea routing algorithm for relevant sections. provides 2 main outputs: "pacificshippingmap.html", which shows the shipping network categorised by operator; "DENSITY.html", which shows a simplified polyline network with segment densities proportional to the amount of service routes passing through those segments
(2) shippinganalysis.py - 
(3) apistuff.py -
